# Smart PDF Reader
A  reader with inbuilt features of popping out the meaning, possible reference and examples would cater to the problem statement in a great effective way.
Inbuilt dictionary, automatic google search and Wikipedia reference are the components we would be embedding in the prototype.

Problem statement 
The major problem faced by people who are willing to read is that they are refrained due to lack of knowledge of the particular language the text is written in and due to lack of resources at the present time they quit reading. Another major problem is the misinterpretation of the context due to lack of meaning of some particular words, quite commonly observed in case of students. There are many students who has lack of knowledge and they understand different meaning of a particular sentence.

So this PDF Reader is a solution for all of these problems.
